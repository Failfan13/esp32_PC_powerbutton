## My intentions

*In short: A way remote way to turn on pc with physical integration*

> In search of finding an alternative to magic packages and IFTTT, I came across a inspiring youtube video that uses this esp32 board controlled by alexa.
After buying the board from aliexpress and relay from amazon I got to work on creating this project. Using multiple youtube and web sources I was able to gather the code and knowledge.

Ultimate goal was to turn on my pc from school without wake on lan and use it running a remote controll program to start a vm.
